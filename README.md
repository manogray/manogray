Yes, here it's manogray. I'm programmer with a heavy experience on automated software testing. Large experience on web development (backend, frontend and infra) and hybrid mobile development. Also I'm InfoSec enthusiastic and already worked with some projects of Embbeded Systems. I always open to learn a new tool to improve my process, as I like to say, you have to study the process not the tool.
