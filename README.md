Yes, here it's manogray. I'm programmer, InfoSec enthusiastic. I already worked with Web Development (Fullstack), Mobile Development and Embbeded Systems development. I always open to learn a new tool, as I like to say, you have to study the process not the tool.

## Main Skills
```javascript
Web Backend = [ 'PHP', 'Node.js' ]
Web Frontend = ['ReactJS', 'VueJS', 'Handcraft']
Infrastructure = ['Docker', 'Docker Compose', 'Docker Machine']
Embbeded Systems = ['Arduino', 'ESP32', 'Raspberry']
InfoSec = ['aircrack-ng']
```
