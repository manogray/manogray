Yes, here it's manogray. I'm programmer, InfoSec enthusiastic and Director of <a href="https://github.com/Bughackers">BugHackers</a>. I already worked with Web Development (Fullstack), Mobile Development and Embbeded Systems development. I always open to learn a new tool, as I like to say, you have to study the process not the tool.

## Main Skills

Web Backend = [ 'PHP', 'Node.js' ]
Web Frontend = ['ReactJS', 'VueJS', 'Handcraft']
Infrastructure = ['Docker', 'Docker Compose', 'Docker Machine']
